You can find some sample configuration files in the <code>examples</code>
directory of the DexGuard distribution.

<h3><a name="androidactivity">A simple Android activity</a></h3>

<img class="float" src="android_small.png" width="20" height="20" alt="tip" />
<i>The standard DexGuard build process already specifies this configuration for
you.</i>
<p>
These options shrink, optimize, obfuscate, and convert the single Android
activity <code>mypackage.MyActivity</code>:
<pre>
-injars      bin/classes
-injars      bin/resources.ap_
-injars      libs
-outjars     bin/application.apk
-libraryjars /usr/local/android-sdk/platforms/android-15/android.jar

-dalvik
-repackageclasses ''
-allowaccessmodification
-optimizations !code/simplification/arithmetic

-keep public class mypackage.MyActivity
</pre>
<p>
We're targeting the Android run-time and keeping the activity as an entry
point.
<p>
We're targeting Android's Dalvik virtual machine, converting the processed
class files straight to the Dex format, with the
<a href="usage.html#dalvik"><code>-dalvik</code></a> option. This way, we
don't need the separate <code>dx</code> compiler anymore.
<p>
The <a href="usage.html#optimizations"><code>-optimizations</code></a> option
disables some arithmetic simplifications that Dalvik 1.0 and 1.5 can't handle.
Note that the Dalvik VM also can't
handle <a href="usage.html#overloadaggressively">aggressive overloading</a>
(of static fields).
<p>
If applicable, you should add options for processing <a href="#native">native
methods</a>, <a href="#callback">callback methods</a>,
<a href="#enumerations">enumerations</a>,
<a href="#annotations">annotations</a>, and
<a href="#resourcefiles">resource files</a>.

<h3><a name="androidapplication">A complete Android application</a></h3>

<img class="float" src="android_small.png" width="20" height="20" alt="tip" />
<i>The standard DexGuard build process already specifies this configuration for
you.</i>
<p>
If you're constructing a build process <em>from scratch</em>: these options
shrink, optimize, and obfuscate all public activities, services, broadcast
receivers, and content providers from the compiled classes and external
libraries:
<pre>
-injars      bin/classes
-injars      bin/resources.ap_
-injars      libs
-outjars     bin/application.apk
-libraryjars /usr/local/android-sdk/platforms/android-15/android.jar

-dalvik
-repackageclasses ''
-allowaccessmodification
-optimizations !code/simplification/arithmetic
-keepattributes *Annotation*
-keepresourcexmlattributenames
    manifest/installLocation,
    manifest/versionCode,
    manifest/application/*/intent-filter/*/name

-keep public class * extends android.app.Activity
-keep public class * extends android.app.Application
-keep public class * extends android.app.Service
-keep public class * extends android.content.BroadcastReceiver
-keep public class * extends android.content.ContentProvider

-keep public class * extends android.view.View {
    public &lt;init&gt;(android.content.Context);
    public &lt;init&gt;(android.content.Context, android.util.AttributeSet);
    public &lt;init&gt;(android.content.Context, android.util.AttributeSet, int);
    public void set*(...);
}

-keepclasseswithmembers class * {
    public &lt;init&gt;(android.content.Context, android.util.AttributeSet);
}

-keepclasseswithmembers class * {
    public &lt;init&gt;(android.content.Context, android.util.AttributeSet, int);
}

-keepclassmembers class * extends android.content.Context {
   public void *(android.view.View);
   public void *(android.view.MenuItem);
}

-keepclassmembers class * implements android.os.Parcelable {
    static ** CREATOR;
}

-keepclassmembers class **.R$* {
    public static &lt;fields&gt;;
}

-keepclassmembers class * {
    @android.webkit.JavascriptInterface &lt;methods&gt;;
}
</pre>
<p>
Most importantly, we're keeping all fundamental classes that may be referenced
by the <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> file of the application. If your
manifest file contains other classes and methods, you may have to specify
those as well.
<p>
We're keeping annotations, since they might be used by custom
<code>RemoteViews</code>.
<p>
We're keeping some attribute names in the binary Android manifest file. The
Android runtime somewhat arbitrarily requires them to launch the application.
Names of other attributes that have numeric identifiers can be discarded.
<p>
We're keeping any custom <code>View</code> extensions and other classes with
typical constructors, since they might be referenced from XML layout files.
<p>
We're also keeping possible <code>onClick</code> handlers in
custom <code>Context</code> extensions, since they might be referenced from
XML layout files.
<p>
We're also keeping the required static fields in <code>Parcelable</code>
implementations, since they are accessed by introspection.
<p>
We're keeping the static fields of referenced inner classes of auto-generated
 <code>R</code> classes, just in case your code is accessing those fields by
introspection. Note that the compiler already inlines primitive fields, so
DexGuard can generally remove all these classes entirely anyway (because the
classes are not referenced and therefore not required).
<p>
Finally, we're keeping annotated Javascript interface methods, so they can be
exported and accessed by their original names. Javascript interface methods
that are not annotated (in code targeted at Android versions older than 4.2)
still need to be preserved manually.
<p>
If you're using additional Google APIs, you'll have to specify
those as well, for instance:
<pre>
-libraryjars /usr/local/android-sdk/add-ons/google_apis-7_r01/libs/maps.jar
</pre>
<p>
If you're using Google's optional License Verification Library, you can
obfuscate its code along with your own code. You do have to preserve
its <code>ILicensingService</code> interface for the library to work:
<pre>
-keep public interface com.android.vending.licensing.ILicensingService
</pre>
<p>
If you're using the Android Compatibility library, you should add the
following line, to let DexGuard know it's ok that the library references some
classes that are not available in all versions of the API:
<pre>
-dontwarn android.support.**
</pre>
<p>
If applicable, you should add options for processing <a href="#native">native
methods</a>, <a href="#callback">callback methods</a>,
<a href="#enumerations">enumerations</a>,
and <a href="#resourcefiles">resource files</a>. You may also want to add
options for producing <a href="#stacktrace">useful stack traces</a> and
to <a href="#logging">remove logging</a>. You can find a complete sample
configuration in <code>examples/android.pro</code> in the DexGuard
distribution.

<h3><a name="scala">Applications with the Scala runtime</a></h3>

These additional options shrink, optimize, and obfuscate Scala applications in
<code>bin/classes</code>:
<pre>
-injars      bin/classes
-injars      bin/resources.ap_
-injars      libs
-injars      /usr/local/scala-2.9.1/lib/scala-library.jar
-outjars     bin/application.apk
-libraryjars /usr/local/android-sdk/platforms/android-15/android.jar

// ... Add the standard settings for Android applications ...

-dontwarn scala.**

-keep class * implements org.xml.sax.EntityResolver

-keepclassmembers class * {
    ** MODULE$;
}

-keepclassmembernames class scala.concurrent.forkjoin.ForkJoinPool {
    long eventCount;
    int  workerCounts;
    int  runControl;
    scala.concurrent.forkjoin.ForkJoinPool$WaitQueueNode syncStack;
    scala.concurrent.forkjoin.ForkJoinPool$WaitQueueNode spareStack;
}

-keepclassmembernames class scala.concurrent.forkjoin.ForkJoinWorkerThread {
    int base;
    int sp;
    int runState;
}

-keepclassmembernames class scala.concurrent.forkjoin.ForkJoinTask {
    int status;
}

-keepclassmembernames class scala.concurrent.forkjoin.LinkedTransferQueue {
    scala.concurrent.forkjoin.LinkedTransferQueue$PaddedAtomicReference head;
    scala.concurrent.forkjoin.LinkedTransferQueue$PaddedAtomicReference tail;
    scala.concurrent.forkjoin.LinkedTransferQueue$PaddedAtomicReference cleanMe;
}
</pre>
<p>
The configuration is an extension of the configuration
for <a href="#activities">processing activities</a>, because Scala is compiled
to ordinary Java bytecode. However, the example processes the Scala runtime
library as well. The processed jar can be an order of magnitude smaller and a
few times faster than the original code (for the Scala code examples, for
instance).
<p>
The <a href="usage.html#dontwarn"><code>-dontwarn</code></a> option tells
DexGuard not to complain about some artefacts in the Scala runtime, the way it
is compiled by the <code>scalac</code> compiler (at least in Scala 2.9.1 and
older). Note that this option should always be used with care.
<p>
The additional <a href="usage.html#keepoverview"><code>-keep</code></a>
options make sure that some classes and some fields that are accessed by means
of introspection are not removed or renamed.
<p>
If applicable, you should add options for processing <a href="#native">native
methods</a>, <a href="#callback">callback methods</a>, <a
href="#enumerations">enumerations</a>, <a href="#serializable">serializable
classes</a>, <a href="#beans">bean classes</a>, <a
href="#annotations">annotations</a>, and <a href="#resourcefiles">resource
files</a>.

<h3><a name="library">A typical library</a></h3>

<img class="float" src="android_small.png" width="20" height="20" alt="tip" />
<i>The standard DexGuard build process already specifies this configuration for
you.</i>
<p>
If you're constructing a build process from scratch: these options shrink,
optimize, and obfuscate an entire library, keeping all public and protected
classes and class members, native method names, and serialization code. The
processed version of the library can then still be used as such, for
developing code based on its public API.
<pre>
-injars       in.jar
-outjars      out.jar
-libraryjars  /usr/local/android-sdk/platforms/android-15/android.jar
-printmapping out.map

-keepparameternames
-renamesourcefileattribute SourceFile
-keepattributes Exceptions,InnerClasses,Signature,Deprecated,
                SourceFile,LineNumberTable,*Annotation*,EnclosingMethod

-keep public class * {
    public protected *;
}

-keepclassmembernames class * {
    java.lang.Class class$(java.lang.String);
    java.lang.Class class$(java.lang.String, boolean);
}

-keepclasseswithmembernames,includedescriptorclasses class * {
    native &lt;methods&gt;;
}

-keepclassmembers,allowoptimization enum * {
    public static **[] values();
    public static ** valueOf(java.lang.String);
}

-keepclassmembers class * implements java.io.Serializable {
    static final long serialVersionUID;
    private static final java.io.ObjectStreamField[] serialPersistentFields;
    private void writeObject(java.io.ObjectOutputStream);
    private void readObject(java.io.ObjectInputStream);
    java.lang.Object writeReplace();
    java.lang.Object readResolve();
}
</pre>
<p>
This configuration should preserve everything we'll ever want to access in the
library. Only if there are any other non-public classes or methods that are
invoked dynamically, they should be specified using additional <a
href="usage.html#keep"><code>-keep</code></a> options.
<p>
The <a
href="usage.html#keepclassmembernames"><code>-keepclassmembernames</code></a>
option for the <code>class$</code> methods is not strictly necessary. These
methods are inserted by the <code>javac</code> compiler and the
<code>jikes</code> compiler respectively, in JDK 1.2 and older, to implement
the <code>.class</code> construct. DexGuard will automatically detect them and
deal with them, even when their names have been obfuscated. However, other
obfuscators may rely on the original method names. It may therefore be helpful
to preserve them, in case these other obfuscators are ever used for further
obfuscation of the library.
<p>
The "Exceptions" attribute has to be preserved, so the compiler knows which
exceptions methods may throw.
<p>
The "InnerClasses" attribute (or more precisely, its source name part) has to
be preserved too, for any inner classes that can be referenced from outside the
library. The <code>javac</code> compiler would be unable to find the inner
classes otherwise.
<p>
The "Signature" attribute is required to be able to access generic types when
compiling in JDK 5.0 and higher.
<p>
The <a href="usage.html#keepparameternames"><code>-keepparameternames</code></a>
option keeps the parameter names in the "LocalVariableTable" and
"LocalVariableTypeTable" attributes of public library methods. Some IDEs can
present these names to the developers who use the library.
<p>
Finally, we're keeping the "Deprecated" attribute and the attributes for
producing <a href="#stacktrace">useful stack traces</a>.
<p>
We've also added some options for for processing <a href="#native">native
methods</a>, <a href="#enumerations">enumerations</a>, <a
href="#serializable">serializable classes</a>, and <a
href="#annotations">annotations</a>, which are all discussed in their
respective examples.

<h3><a name="native">Processing native methods</a></h3>

<img class="float" src="android_small.png" width="20" height="20" alt="tip" />
<i>The standard DexGuard build process already specifies this configuration for
you.</i>
<p>
If your application contains native methods, you'll want to preserve their
names and their classes' names, so they can still be linked to the native
library. The following additional option will ensure that:
<pre>
-keepclasseswithmembernames,includedescriptorclasses class * {
    native &lt;methods&gt;;
}
</pre>
<p>
Note the use of
<a href="usage.html#keepclasseswithmembernames"><code>-keepclasseswithmembernames</code></a>.
We don't want to preserve all classes or all native methods; we just want to
keep the relevant names from being obfuscated. The modifier
<a href="usage.html#includedescriptorclasses">includedescriptorclasses</a>
additionally makes sure that the return types and parameter types aren't
renamed either, so the entire signatures remain compatible with the native
libraries.
<p>
DexGuard doesn't look at your native code, so it won't automatically preserve
the classes or class members that are invoked by the native code. These are
entry points, which you'll have to specify explicitly.  <a
href="callback">Callback methods</a> are discussed below as a typical example.

<h3><a name="callback">Processing callback methods</a></h3>

If your application contains callback methods, which are called from external
code (native code, scripts,...), you'll want to preserve them, and probably
their classes too. They are just entry points to your code, much like, say,
the main method of an application. If they aren't preserved by
other <code>-keep</code> options, something like the following option will
keep the callback class and method:
<pre>
-keep class mypackage.MyCallbackClass {
    void myCallbackMethod(java.lang.String);
}
</pre>
<p>
This will preserve the given class and method from being removed or renamed.

<h3><a name="enumerations">Processing enumeration classes</a></h3>

<img class="float" src="android_small.png" width="20" height="20" alt="tip" />
<i>The standard DexGuard build process already specifies this configuration for
you.</i>
<p>
If your application contains enumeration classes, you'll have to preserve some
special methods. Enumerations were introduced in Java 5. The java compiler
translates enumerations into classes with a special structure. Notably, the
classes contain implementations of some static methods that the run-time
environment accesses by introspection (Isn't that just grand? Introspection is
the self-modifying code of a new generation). You have to specify these
explicitly, to make sure they aren't removed or obfuscated:
<pre>
-keepclassmembers,allowoptimization enum * {
    public static **[] values();
    public static ** valueOf(java.lang.String);
}
</pre>

<h3><a name="serializable">Processing serializable classes</a></h3>

More complex applications may contain classes that are serialized. Depending
on the way in which they are used, they may require special attention:
<ul>

<li>Often, serialization is simply a means of transporting data, without
    long-term storage. Classes that are shrunk and obfuscated should then
    continue to function fine with the following additional options:

<pre>
-keepclassmembers class * implements java.io.Serializable {
    private static final java.io.ObjectStreamField[] serialPersistentFields;
    private void writeObject(java.io.ObjectOutputStream);
    private void readObject(java.io.ObjectInputStream);
    java.lang.Object writeReplace();
    java.lang.Object readResolve();
}
</pre>
<p>

    The <a
    href="usage.html#keepclassmembers"><code>-keepclassmembers</code></a>
    option makes sure that any serialization methods are kept. By using this
    option instead of the basic <code>-keep</code> option, we're not
    forcing preservation of <i>all</i> serializable classes, just preservation
    of the listed members of classes that are actually used.</li>

<li>Sometimes, the serialized data are stored, and read back later into newer
    versions of the serializable classes. One then has to take care the classes
    remain compatible with their unprocessed versions and with future
    processed versions. In such cases, the relevant classes will most likely
    have <code>serialVersionUID</code> fields. The following options should
    then be sufficient to ensure compatibility over time:

<pre>
-keepnames class * implements java.io.Serializable

-keepclassmembers class * implements java.io.Serializable {
    static final long serialVersionUID;
    private static final java.io.ObjectStreamField[] serialPersistentFields;
    !static !transient &lt;fields&gt;;
    private void writeObject(java.io.ObjectOutputStream);
    private void readObject(java.io.ObjectInputStream);
    java.lang.Object writeReplace();
    java.lang.Object readResolve();
}
</pre>
<p>

    The <code>serialVersionUID</code> and <code>serialPersistentFields</code>
    lines makes sure those fields are preserved, if they are present.
    The <code>&lt;fields&gt;</code> line preserves all non-static,
    non-transient fields, with their original names. The introspection of the
    serialization process and the de-serialization process will then find
    consistent names.</li>

<li>Occasionally, the serialized data have to remain compatible, but the
    classes involved lack <code>serialVersionUID</code> fields. I imagine the
    original code will then be hard to maintain, since the serial version UID
    is then computed from a list of features the serializable class. Changing
    the class ever so slightly may change the computed serial version UID. The
    list of features is specified in the section on <a
    href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/platform/serialization/spec/class.html#a4100">Stream
    Unique Identifiers</a> of Sun's <a
    href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/platform/serialization/spec/serialTOC.html">Java
    Object Serialization Specification</a>. The following directives should at
    least partially ensure compatibility with the original classes:

<pre>
-keepnames class * implements java.io.Serializable

-keepclassmembers class * implements java.io.Serializable {
    static final long serialVersionUID;
    private static final java.io.ObjectStreamField[] serialPersistentFields;
    !static !transient &lt;fields&gt;;
    !private &lt;fields&gt;;
    !private &lt;methods&gt;;
    private void writeObject(java.io.ObjectOutputStream);
    private void readObject(java.io.ObjectInputStream);
    java.lang.Object writeReplace();
    java.lang.Object readResolve();
}
</pre>
<p>

    The new options force preservation of the elements involved in the UID
    computation. In addition, the user will have to manually specify all
    interfaces of the serializable classes (using something like "<code>-keep
    interface MyInterface</code>"), since these names are also used when
    computing the UID. A fast but sub-optimal alternative would be simply
    keeping all interfaces with "<code>-keep interface *</code>".</li>

<li>In the rare event that you are serializing lambda expressions in Java 8 or
    higher, you need to preserve some methods and adapt the hard-coded names
    of the classes in which they occur:

<pre>
-keepclassmembers class * {
    private static synthetic java.lang.Object $deserializeLambda$(java.lang.invoke.SerializedLambda);
}

-keepclassmembernames class * {
    private static synthetic *** lambda$*(...);
}

-adaptclassstrings com.example.Test
</pre>
<p>

    This should satisfy the reflection in the deserialization code of the
    Java run-time.

</ul>
<p>

Note that the above options may preserve more classes and class members
than strictly necessary. For instance, a large number of classes may implement
the <code>Serialization</code> interface, yet only a small number may actually
ever be serialized. Knowing your application and tuning the configuration
often produces more compact results.

<h3><a name="beans">Processing bean classes</a></h3>

If your application makes extensive use of introspection on bean classes to
find bean editor classes, or getter and setter methods, then configuration may
become painful. There's not much else you can do than making sure the bean
class names, or the getter and setter names don't change. For instance:
<pre>
-keep public class mypackage.MyBean {
    public void setMyProperty(int);
    public int getMyProperty();
}

-keep public class mypackage.MyBeanEditor
</pre>
<p>
If there are too many elements to list explicitly, wildcards in class names
and method signatures might be helpful. This example preserves all possible
setters and getters in classes in the package <code>mybeans</code>:
<pre>
-keep class mybeans.** {
    void set*(***);
    void set*(int, ***);

    boolean is*(); 
    boolean is*(int);

    *** get*();
    *** get*(int);
}
</pre>
<p>
The '<code>***</code>' wildcard matches any type (primitive or non-primitive,
array or non-array). The methods with the '<code>int</code>' arguments matches
properties that are lists.

<h3><a name="annotations">Processing annotations</a></h3>

<img class="float" src="android_small.png" width="20" height="20" alt="tip" />
<i>The standard DexGuard build process already specifies this configuration for
you.</i>
<p>
If your application uses annotations, you may want to preserve them in the
processed output. Annotations are represented by attributes that have no
direct effect on the execution of the code. However, their values can be
retrieved through introspection, allowing developers to adapt the execution
behavior accordingly. By default, DexGuard treats annotation attributes as
optional, and removes them in the obfuscation step. If they are required,
you'll have to specify this explicitly:
<pre>
-keepattributes *Annotation*
</pre>
<p>
For brevity, we're specifying a wildcarded attribute name, which will match
<code>RuntimeVisibleAnnotations</code>,
<code>RuntimeInvisibleAnnotations</code>,
<code>RuntimeVisibleParameterAnnotations</code>,
<code>RuntimeInvisibleParameterAnnotations</code>, and
<code>AnnotationDefault</code>. Depending on the purpose of the processed
code, you could refine this selection, for instance not keeping the run-time
invisible annotations (which are only used at compile-time).
<p>
Some code may make further use of introspection to figure out the enclosing
methods of anonymous inner classes. In that case, the corresponding attribute
has to be preserved as well:
<pre>
-keepattributes EnclosingMethod
</pre>

<h3><a name="database">Processing database drivers</a></h3>

Database drivers are implementations of the <code>Driver</code> interface.
Since they are often created dynamically, you may want to preserve any
implementations that you are processing as entry points:
<pre>
-keep class * implements java.sql.Driver
</pre>
<p>
This option also gets rid of the note that DexGuard prints out about
<code>(java.sql.Driver)Class.forName</code> constructs, if you are
instantiating a driver in your code (without necessarily implementing any
drivers yourself).

<h3><a name="injection">Processing resource injection</a></h3>

If your application is using JEE-style resource injection, the application
container will automatically assign instances of resource classes to fields and
methods that are annotated with <code>@Resource</code>. The container applies
introspection, even accessing private class members directly. It typically
constructs a resource name based on the type name and the class member name.
We then have to avoid that such class members are removed or renamed:
<pre>
-keepclassmembers class * {
    @javax.annotation.Resource *;
}
</pre>
<p>
The Spring framework has another similar annotation <code>@Autowired</code>:
<pre>
-keepclassmembers class * {
    @org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired *;
}
</pre>

<h3><a name="resourcefiles">Processing resource files</a></h3>

If your application contains resource files, it may be necessary to adapt
their names and/or their contents when the application is obfuscated. The
following two options can achieve this automatically:
<pre>
-adaptresourcefilenames    **.properties,**.gif,**.jpg
-adaptresourcefilecontents **.properties,META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
</pre>
<p>
The <a href="usage.html#adaptresourcefilenames">-adaptresourcefilenames</a>
option in this case renames properties files and image files in the processed
output, based on the obfuscated names of their corresponding class files (if
any). The <a
href="usage.html#adaptresourcefilecontents">-adaptresourcefilecontents</a>
option looks for class names in properties files and in the manifest file, and
replaces these names by the obfuscated names (if any). You'll probably want to
adapt the filters to suit your application.

<h3><a name="manifestfiles">Processing manifest files</a></h3>

As illustrated in the previous section, manifest files can be treated like
ordinary resource files. DexGuard can adapt obfuscated class names in the
files, but it won't make any other changes. If you want anything else, you
should apply an external tool. For instance, if a manifest file contains
signing information, you should sign the jar again after it has been
processed.
<p>
If you're merging several input jars into a single output jar, you'll have to 
pick one, typically by specifying <a href="usage.html#filters">filters</a>:
<pre>
-injars  in1.jar
-injars  in2.jar(!META-INF/MANIFEST.MF)
-injars  in3.jar(!META-INF/MANIFEST.MF)
-outjars out.jar
</pre>
<p>
The filters will let DexGuard copy the manifest file from the first jar and
ignore any manifest files in the second and third input jars. Note that
DexGuard will leave the order of the files in the jars unchanged; manifest
files are not necessarily put first.

<h3><a name="accessthroughreflection">Adding reflection for sensitive APIs</a></h3>

You can add reflection to obfuscate access to sensitive APIs, with the option
<a href="usage.html#accessthroughreflection">-accessthroughreflection</a>. For
instance, this option replaces access to the standard
cryptographic <code>SecretKey</code> class by equivalent reflective code:
<pre>
-accessthroughreflection class javax.crypto.SecretKey {
    byte[] getEncoded();
}
</pre>
<p>
For better obfuscation, you'll typically want to encrypt the resulting strings:
<pre>
-encryptstrings "javax.crypto.SecretKey", "getEncoded"
</pre>
or simply all strings in the class from which the cryptographic class is
called:
<pre>
-encryptstrings mypackage.MySecretClass
</pre>
<p>
Finally, you can add another layer of obfuscation by also encrypting the
latter class:
<pre>
-encryptclasses mypackage.MySecretClass
</pre>

<h3><a name="encryptclasses">Encrypting classes</a></h3>

You can encrypt entire classes by specifying them with the
option <a href="usage.html#encryptclasses">-encryptclasses</a>. It accepts
a <a href="usage.html#filters">filter</a>, which can contain wildcards and
negators. For example:
<pre>
-encryptclasses mypackage.MySecretClass, mypackage.MySecretClass$*
</pre>
This option instructs to encrypt the specified class and all of its inner
classes. The latter classes are easy to forget, because they are defined in
the same source file, but they may be important too.

<h3><a name="encryptstrings">Encrypting strings</a></h3>

There are a few alternative ways to specify which constant strings in the code
should be encrypted, with the
option <a href="usage.html#encryptstrings">-encryptstrings</a>. The shortest
way is to specify the strings literally:
<pre>
-encryptstrings "Some secret string", "Some other secret string"
</pre>
In this case, the option has a <a href="usage.html#filters">filter</a>, which
can contain wildcards and negators.
<p>
Alternatively, you can specify <code>final String</code> fields, whose strings
should be encrypted wherever they occur. For example:
<pre>
-encryptstrings public class mypackage.MyConstants {
    public static final java.lang.String SECRET_KEY;
}
</pre>
<p>
Alternatively, you can specify methods whose constant strings should all be
encrypted. For example:
<pre>
-encryptstrings public class mypackage.MySensitiveClass {
    public void mySecretMethod();
}
</pre>
<p>
Finally, you can just specify classes whose constant strings should all be
encrypted. For example:
<pre>
-encryptstrings public class mypackage.MySecretClass
</pre>
In these last three cases, the options
have <a href="usage.html#classspecification">class specifications</a> that
specify one or more classes, fields, or methods. These specifications support
multiple elements and various wildcards.

<h3><a name="stacktrace">Producing useful obfuscated stack traces</a></h3>

<img class="float" src="android_small.png" width="20" height="20" alt="tip" />
<i>The standard DexGuard build process already specifies this configuration for
you.</i>
<p>
These options let obfuscated applications or libraries produce stack traces
that can still be deciphered later on:
<pre>
-printmapping out.map

-renamesourcefileattribute SourceFile
-keepattributes SourceFile,LineNumberTable
</pre>
<p>
We're keeping all source file attributes, but we're replacing their values by
the string "SourceFile". We could use any string. This string is already
present in all class files, so it doesn't take up any extra space. If you're
working with J++, you'll want to keep the "SourceDir" attribute as well.
<p>
We're also keeping the line number tables of all methods.
<p>
Whenever both of these attributes are present, the Java run-time environment
will include line number information when printing out exception stack traces.
<p>
The information will only be useful if we can map the obfuscated names back to
their original names, so we're saving the mapping to a file
<code>out.map</code>. The information can then be used by the <a
href="retrace/index.html">ReTrace</a> tool to restore the original stack trace.

<h3><a name="repackaging">Obfuscating package names</a></h3>

<img class="float" src="android_small.png" width="20" height="20" alt="tip" />
<i>The standard DexGuard build process already specifies this configuration for
you.</i>
<p>
Package names can be obfuscated in various ways, with increasing levels of
obfuscation and compactness. For example, consider the following classes:
<pre>
mycompany.myapplication.MyMain
mycompany.myapplication.Foo
mycompany.myapplication.Bar
mycompany.myapplication.extra.FirstExtra
mycompany.myapplication.extra.SecondExtra
mycompany.util.FirstUtil
mycompany.util.SecondUtil
</pre>
<p>
Let's assume the class name <code>mycompany.myapplication.MyMain</code> is the
main application class that is kept by the configuration. All other class names
can be obfuscated.
<p>
By default, packages that contain classes that can't be renamed aren't renamed
either, and the package hierarchy is preserved. This results in obfuscated
class names like these:
<pre>
mycompany.myapplication.MyMain
mycompany.myapplication.a
mycompany.myapplication.b
mycompany.myapplication.a.a
mycompany.myapplication.a.b
mycompany.a.a
mycompany.a.b
</pre>
<p>
The <a
href="usage.html#flattenpackagehierarchy"><code>-flattenpackagehierarchy</code></a>
option obfuscates the package names further, by flattening the package
hierarchy of obfuscated packages:
<pre>
-flattenpackagehierarchy 'myobfuscated'
</pre>
<p>
The obfuscated class names then look as follows:
<pre>
mycompany.myapplication.MyMain
mycompany.myapplication.a
mycompany.myapplication.b
myobfuscated.a.a
myobfuscated.a.b
myobfuscated.b.a
myobfuscated.b.b
</pre>
<p>
Alternatively, the <a
href="usage.html#repackageclasses"><code>-repackageclasses</code></a> option
obfuscates the entire packaging, by combining obfuscated classes into a single
package:
<pre>
-repackageclasses 'myobfuscated'
</pre>
The obfuscated class names then look as follows:
<pre>
mycompany.myapplication.MyMain
mycompany.myapplication.a
mycompany.myapplication.b
myobfuscated.a
myobfuscated.b
myobfuscated.c
myobfuscated.d
</pre>
<p>
Additionally specifying the <a
href="usage.html#allowaccessmodification"><code>-allowaccessmodification</code></a>
option allows access permissions of classes and class members to
be broadened, opening up the opportunity to repackage all obfuscated classes:
<pre>
-repackageclasses 'myobfuscated'
-allowaccessmodification
</pre>
The obfuscated class names then look as follows:
<pre>
mycompany.myapplication.MyMain
myobfuscated.a
myobfuscated.b
myobfuscated.c
myobfuscated.d
myobfuscated.e
myobfuscated.f
</pre>
<p>
The specified target package can always be the root package. For instance:
<pre>
-repackageclasses ''
-allowaccessmodification
</pre>
The obfuscated class names are then the shortest possible names:
<pre>
mycompany.myapplication.MyMain
a
b
c
d
e
f
</pre>
<p>
Note that not all levels of obfuscation of package names may be acceptable for
all code. Notably, you may have to take into account that your application may
contain <a href="#resourcefiles">resource files</a> that have to be adapted.

<h3><a name="samsungmarket">Publishing on the Samsung app market</a></h3>

If you're publishing your Android application on the Samsung app market, and
you get "File upload has failed. There is no application ID(PackageName) or
Version information(VersionName) in the Android Manifest.xml file you have
registered.", then you need to preserve the mentioned resource XML attribute
names in the <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code>:
<pre>
-keepresourcexmlattributenames manifest/package,manifest/versionName 
</pre>
<p>
The Samsung market parses these attributes when you upload your application,
and they can't handle obfuscated names.
<p>
Other markets may try to read even more attributes. You could then refine your
configuration experimentally, or just not obfuscate any attributes in the
manifest at all:
<pre>
-keepresourcexmlattributenames manifest/**
</pre>

<h3><a name="logging">Removing logging code</a></h3>

You can let DexGuard remove logging code. The trick is to specify that the
logging methods don't have side-effects &mdash; even though they actually do,
since they write to the console or to a log file. DexGuard will take your word
for it and remove the invocations (in the optimization step) and if possible
the logging classes and methods themselves (in the shrinking step).
<p>
For example, this configuration removes invocations of the Android logging
methods:
<pre>
-assumenosideeffects class android.util.Log {
    public static boolean isLoggable(java.lang.String, int);
    public static int v(...);
    public static int i(...);
    public static int w(...);
    public static int d(...);
    public static int e(...);
}
</pre>
<p>
The wildcards are a shortcut to match all versions of the methods.
<p>
Note that you generally can't remove logging code that uses
<code>System.out.println</code>, since you would be removing all invocations
of <code>java.io.PrintStream#println</code>, which could break your
application. You can work around it by creating your own logging methods and
let DexGuard remove those.

<h3><a name="restructuring">Restructuring the output archives</a></h3>

In simple applications, all output classes and resources files are merged into
a single jar. For example:
<pre>
-injars  classes
-injars  in1.jar
-injars  in2.jar
-injars  in3.jar
-outjars out.jar
</pre>
<p>
This configuration merges the processed versions of the files in the
<code>classes</code> directory and the three jars into a single output jar
<code>out.jar</code>.
<p>
If you want to preserve the structure of your input jars (and/or wars, ears,
zips, apks, or directories), you can specify an output directory (or a war, an
ear, a zip, or an apk). For example:
<pre>
-injars  in1.jar
-injars  in2.jar
-injars  in3.jar
-outjars out
</pre>
<p>
The input jars will then be reconstructed in the directory <code>out</code>,
with their original names.
<p>
You can also combine archives into higher level archives. For example:
<pre>
-injars  in1.jar
-injars  in2.jar
-injars  in3.jar
-outjars out.war
</pre>
<p>
The other way around, you can flatten the archives inside higher level
archives into simple archives:
<pre>
-injars  in.war
-outjars out.jar
</pre>
<p>
This configuration puts the processed contents of all jars inside
<code>in.war</code> (plus any other contents of <code>in.war</code>) into
<code>out.jar</code>.
<p>
If you want to combine input jars (and/or wars, ears, zips, apks, or
directories) into output jars (and/or wars, ears, zips, apks, or directories),
you can group the <a href="usage.html#injars"><code>-injars</code></a> and <a
href="usage.html#outjars"><code>-outjars</code></a> options. For example:
<pre>
-injars base_in1.jar
-injars base_in2.jar
-injars base_in3.jar
-outjars base_out.jar

-injars  extra_in.jar
-outjars extra_out.jar
</pre>
<p>
This configuration puts the processed results of all <code>base_in*.jar</code>
jars into <code>base_out.jar</code>, and the processed results of the
<code>extra_in.jar</code> into <code>extra_out.jar</code>. Note that only the
order of the options matters; the additional whitespace is just for clarity.
<p>
This grouping, archiving, and flattening can be arbitrarily complex. DexGuard
always tries to package output archives in a sensible way, reconstructing the
input entries as much as required.

<h3><a name="filtering">Filtering the input and the output</a></h3>

<img class="float" src="android_small.png" width="20" height="20" alt="tip" />
<i>The standard DexGuard build process already specifies this configuration for
you.</i>
<p>
If you want even greater control, you can add
<a href="usage.html#filters">filters</a> to the input and the output,
filtering out zips, ears, wars, jars, apks, and/or ordinary files. For
example, if you want to disregard certain files from an input jar:
<pre>
-injars  in.jar(!images/**)
-outjars out.jar
</pre>
<p>
This configuration removes any files in the <code>images</code> directory and
its subdirectories.
<p>
Such filters can be convenient for avoiding warnings about duplicate files in
the output. For example, only keeping the manifest file from a first input jar:
<pre>
-injars  in1.jar
-injars  in2.jar(!META-INF/MANIFEST.MF)
-injars  in3.jar(!META-INF/MANIFEST.MF)
-outjars out.jar
</pre>
<p>
It is also possible to filter the jars (and/or wars, ears, zips, apks)
themselves, based on their names. For example:
<pre>
-injars  in(**/acme_*.jar;)
-outjars out.jar
</pre>
<p>
Note the semi-colon in the filter; the filter in front of it applies to jar
names. In this case, only <code>acme_*.jar</code> jars are read from the
directory <code>in</code> and its subdirectories. Filters for war names, ear
names, and zip names can be prefixed with additional semi-colons. All types of
filters can be combined. They are orthogonal.
<p>
On the other hand, you can also filter the output, in order to control what
content goes where. For example:
<pre>
-injars  in.jar
-outjars code_out.jar(**.class)
-outjars resources_out.jar
</pre>
<p>
This configuration splits the processed output, sending <code>**.class</code>
files to <code>code_out.jar</code>, and all remaining files to
<code>resources_out.jar</code>.
<p>
Again, the filtering can be arbitrarily complex, especially when combined with
grouping input and output.

<h3><a name="multiple">Processing multiple applications at once</a></h3>

You can process several dependent or independent applications in one go, in
order to save time and effort. DexGuard's input and output handling offers
various ways to keep the output nicely structured.
<p>
The easiest way is to specify your input jars (and/or wars, ears, zips, apks,
and directories) and a single output directory. DexGuard will then reconstruct
the input in this directory, using the original jar names. For example,
showing just the input and output options:
<pre>
-injars  application1.jar
-injars  application2.jar
-injars  application3.jar
-outjars processed_applications
</pre>
<p>
After processing, the directory <code>processed_applications</code> will
contain processed versions of application jars, with their original names.

<h3><a name="deadcode">Finding dead code</a></h3>

These options list unused classes, fields, and methods in the application
<code>mypackage.MyApplication</code>:
<pre>
-injars      in.jar
-libraryjars /usr/local/android-sdk/platforms/android-15/android.jar

-dontoptimize
-dontobfuscate
-dontpreverify
-printusage

-keep public class mypackage.MyApplication {
    public static void main(java.lang.String[]);
}
</pre>
<p>
We're not specifying an output jar, just printing out some results. We're
saving some processing time by skipping the other processing steps.
<p>
The java compiler inlines primitive constants and String constants
(<code>static final</code> fields). DexGuard would therefore list such fields
as not being used in the class files that it analyzes, even if they <i>are</i>
used in the source files. We can add a <a
href="usage.html#keepclassmembers"><code>-keepclassmembers</code></a> option
that keeps those fields a priori, in order to avoid having them listed:
<pre>
-keepclassmembers class * {
    static final %                *;
    static final java.lang.String *;
}
</pre>

<h3><a name="annotated">Using annotations to configure DexGuard</a></h3>

The traditional DexGuard configuration allows to keep a clean separation
between the code and the configuration for shrinking, optimization, and
obfuscation. However, it is also possible to define specific annotations,
and then annotate the code to configure the processing.
<p>
You can find a set of such predefined annotations in the directory
<code>examples/annotations/lib</code> in the DexGuard distribution.
The annotation classes are defined in <code>annotations.jar</code>. The
corresponding DexGuard configuration (or meta-configuration, if you prefer)
is specified in <code>annotations.pro</code>. With these files, you can start
annotating your code. For instance, a java source file
<code>Application.java</code> can be annotated as follows:
<pre>
@KeepApplication
public class Application {
  ....
}
</pre>
<p>
The DexGuard configuration file for the application can then be simplified by
leveraging off these annotations:
<pre>
-injars      in.jar
-outjars     out.jar
-libraryjars /usr/local/android-sdk/platforms/android-15/android.jar

-include lib/annotations.pro
</pre>
<p>
The annotations are effectively replacing the application-dependent
<code>-keep</code> options. You may still wish to add traditional
<code>-keep</code> options for processing <a href="#native">native
methods</a>, <a href="#enumerations">enumerations</a>, <a
href="#serializable">serializable classes</a>, and <a
href="#annotations">annotations</a>.
<p>
The directory <code>examples/annotations</code> contains more examples that
illustrate some of the possibilities.
