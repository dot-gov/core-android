<h2><a name="processing">Problems while processing</a></h2>

DexGuard may print out some notes and non-fatal warnings:

<dl>
<dt><a name="dynamicalclass"><b>Note: can't find dynamically referenced class ...</b></a></dt>

<dd>DexGuard can't find a class or interface that your code is accessing by
    means of introspection. You should consider adding the jar that contains
    this class.</dd>

<dt><a name="dynamicalclasscast"><b>Note: ... calls '(...)Class.forName(variable).newInstance()'</b></a></dt>

<dd>Your code uses reflection to dynamically create class instances, with a
    construct like
    "<code>(MyClass)Class.forName(variable).newInstance()</code>". Depending
    on your application, you may need to keep the mentioned classes with an
    option like "<code>-keep class MyClass</code>", or their implementations
    with an option like "<code>-keep class * implements MyClass</code>". You
    can switch off these notes by specifying the
    <a href="usage.html#dontnote"><code>-dontnote</code></a> option.</dd>

<dt><a name="dynamicalclassmember"><b>Note: ... accesses a field/method '...' dynamically</b></a></dt>

<dd>Your code uses reflection to find a fields or a method, with a construct
    like "<code>.getField("myField")</code>". Depending on your application,
    you may need to figure out where the mentioned class members are defined
    and keep them with an option like "<code>-keep class MyClass { MyFieldType
    myField; }</code>". Otherwise, DexGuard might remove or obfuscate the
    class members, since it can't know which ones they are exactly. It does
    list possible candidates, for your information. You can switch off these
    notes by specifying
    the <a href="usage.html#dontnote"><code>-dontnote</code></a> option.</dd>

<dt><a name="attributes"><b>Note: ... calls 'Class.get...'</b>, <b>'Field.get...'</b>, or <b>'Method.get...'</b></a></dt>
<dd>Your code uses reflection to access metadata from the code, with an
    invocation like "<code>class.getAnnotations()</code>". You then generally
    need to preserve optional <a href="attributes.html">class file
    attributes</a>, which DexGuard removes by default. The attributes contain
    information about annotations, enclosing classes, enclosing methods, etc.
    In a summary in the log, DexGuard provides a suggested configuration,
    like <a href="usage.html#keepattributes"><code>-keepattributes
    *Annotation*</code></a>. If you're sure the attributes are not necessary,
    you can switch off these notes by specifying
    the <a href="usage.html#dontnote"><code>-dontnote</code></a> option.</dd>

<dt><a name="webview"><b>Note: ... calls 'WebView.addJavascriptInterface' for ...</b></a></dt>

<dd>DexGuard lists a number of constructs like
    "<code>webView.addJavascriptInterface(new MyInterfaceClass(),
    "myInterfaceName")</code>". Such a construct means that the Javascript
    code in the web view can invoke methods in <code>MyInterfaceClass</code>.
    You should therefore let DexGuard know not to remove or rename those
    methods. If the methods are already annotated
    with <code>@JavascriptInterface</code> (as required as of Android SDK 17),
    the <a href="examples.html#androidapplication">default configuration for
    Android</a> will take care of it. Otherwise, you have to keep the methods
    with an option like "<code>-keepclassmembers class MyInterfaceClass {
    public &lt;methods&gt;; }</code>". You can switch off these notes by
    specifying the <a href="usage.html#dontnote"><code>-dontnote</code></a>
    option.</dd>

<dt><a name="unknownclass"><b>Note: the configuration refers to the unknown class  '...'</b></a></dt>

<dd>Your configuration refers to the name of a class that is not present in
    the program jars or library jars. You should check whether the name is
    correct. Notably, you should make sure that you always specify
    fully-qualified names, not forgetting the package names.</dd>

<dt><a name="descriptorclass"><b>Note: the configuration keeps the entry point '...', but not the descriptor class '...'</b></a></dt>

<dd>Your configuration contains a <code>-keep</code> option to preserve the
    given method (or field), but no <code>-keep</code> option for the given
    class that is an argument type or return type in the method's descriptor.
    You may then want to keep the class too. Otherwise, DexGuard will
    obfuscate its name, thus changing the method's signature. The method might
    then become unfindable as an entry point, e.g. if it is part of a public
    API. You can automatically keep such descriptor classes with
    the <code>-keep</code> option modifier
    <a href="usage.html#includedescriptorclasses"><code>includedescriptorclasses</code></a>
    (<code>-keep,includedescriptorclasses</code> ...). You can switch off
    these notes by specifying
    the <a href="usage.html#dontnote"><code>-dontnote</code></a> option.</dd>

<dt><a name="libraryclass"><b>Note: the configuration explicitly specifies '...' to keep library class '...'</b></a></dt>

<dd>Your configuration contains a <code>-keep</code> option to preserve the
    given library class. However, you don't need to keep any library classes.
    DexGuard always leaves underlying libraries unchanged. You can switch off
    these notes by specifying the
    <a href="usage.html#dontnote"><code>-dontnote</code></a> option.</dd>

<dt><a name="classmembers"><b>Note: the configuration doesn't specify which class members to keep for class '...'</b></a></dt>

<dd>Your configuration contains a
    <a href="usage.html#keepclassmembers"><code>-keepclassmembers</code></a>/<a href="usage.html#keepclasseswithmembers"><code>-keepclasseswithmembers</code></a>
    option to preserve fields or methods in the given class, but it doesn't
    specify which fields or methods. This way, the option simply won't have
    any effect. You probably want to specify one or more fields or methods, as
    usual between curly braces. You can specify all fields or methods with a
    wildcard "<code>*;</code>". You should also consider if you just need the
    more common <a href="usage.html#keep"><code>-keep</code></a> option, which
    preserves all specified classes <i>and</i> class members.
    The <a href="usage.html#keepoverview">overview of all <code>keep</code>
    options</a> can help. You can switch off these notes by specifying
    the <a href="usage.html#dontnote"><code>-dontnote</code></a> option.</dd>

<dt><a name="nosideeffects"><b>Note: the configuration specifies that none of the methods of class '...' have any side effects</b></a></dt>

<dd>Your configuration contains an option
    <a href="usage.html#assumenosideeffects"><code>-assumenosideeffects</code></a>
    to indicate that the specified methods don't have any side effects.
    However, the configuration tries to match <i>all</i> methods, by using a
    wildcard like "<code>*;</code>". This includes methods
    from <code>java.lang.Object</code>, such as <code>wait()</code> and
    <code>notify()</code>. Removing invocations of those methods will most
    likely break your application. You should list the methods without side
    effects more conservatively. You can switch off these notes by specifying
    the <a href="usage.html#dontnote"><code>-dontnote</code></a> option.</dd>

<dt><a name="duplicateclass"><b>Note: duplicate definition of program/library class</b></a></dt>

<dd>Your program jars or library jars contain multiple definitions of the
    listed classes. DexGuard continues processing as usual, only considering
    the first definitions. The warning may be an indication of some problem
    though, so it's advisable to remove the duplicates. A convenient way to do
    so is by specifying filters on the input jars or library jars. You can
    switch off these notes by specifying the <a
    href="usage.html#dontnote"><code>-dontnote</code></a> option.
    <p>
    The standard Android and DexGuard build processes automatically
    specify the input jars for you. There may not be an easy way to filter
    them to remove these notes. You could remove the duplicate classes
    manually from your libraries. You should never explicitly specify the
    input jars yourself (with <code>-injars</code> or
    <code>-libraryjars</code>), since you'll then get duplicate definitions.
    You should also not add libraries to your application that are already
    part of the Android run-time (notably <code>org.w3c.dom</code>,
    <code>org.xml.sax</code>, <code>org.xmlpull.v1</code>,
    <code>org.apache.commons.logging.Log</code>, <code>org.apache.http</code>,
    and <code>org.json</code>). They are possibly inconsistent, and the
    run-time libraries would get precedence anyway.</dd>

<dt><a name="duplicatezipentry"><b>Warning: can't write resource ... Duplicate zip entry</b></a></dt>

<dd>Your input jars contain multiple resource files with the same name.
    DexGuard continues copying the resource files as usual, skipping any files
    with previously used names. Once more, the warning may be an indication of
    some problem though, so it's advisable to remove the duplicates. A
    convenient way to do so is by specifying filters on the input jars. There
    is no option to switch off these warnings.
    <p>
    The standard Android and DexGuard build processes automatically
    specify the input jars for you. There may not be an easy way to filter
    them to remove these warnings. You could remove the duplicate resource files
    manually from the input and the libraries.</dd>

</dl>
<p>

DexGuard may terminate when it encounters parsing errors or I/O errors, or
some more serious warnings:

<dl>
<dt><a name="unresolvedclass"><b>Warning: can't find superclass or interface</b><br/><b>Warning: can't find referenced class</b></a></dt>

<dd>A class in one of your program jars or library jars is referring to a
    class or interface that is missing from the input. The warning lists both
    the referencing class(es) and the missing referenced class(es). There can
    be a few reasons, with their own solutions:
    <p>
    <ol>
    <li>If the missing class is referenced from your own code, you may have
        forgotten to specify an essential library. Just like when compiling
        all code from scratch, you must specify all libraries that the code is
        referencing, directly or indirectly. If the library should be
        processed and included in the output, you should specify it with
        <a href="usage.html#injars"><code>-injars</code></a>, otherwise you
        should specify it with
        <a href="usage.html#libraryjars"><code>-libraryjars</code></a>.
        <p>
        For example, if DexGuard complains that it can't find a
        <code>java.lang</code> class, you have to make sure that you are
        specifying the run-time library of your platform. For Android, it is
        typically packaged in <code>android.jar</code>.</li>
    <li>If the missing class is referenced from a pre-compiled third-party
        library, and your original code runs fine without it, then the missing
        dependency doesn't seem to hurt. The cleanest solution is to
        <a href="usage.html#filters">filter out</a> the <i>referencing</i>
        class or classes from the input, with a filter like "<code>-injars
        myapplication.jar(!somepackage/SomeUnusedReferencingClass.class)</code>".
        DexGuard will then skip this class entirely in the input, and it will
        not bump into the problem of its missing reference. However, you may
        then have to filter out other classes that are in turn referencing the
        removed class. In practice, this works best if you can filter out
        entire unused packages at once, with a wildcard filter like
        "<code>-libraryjars
        mylibrary.jar(!someunusedpackage/**)</code>".<p></li>
    <li>If you don't feel like filtering out the problematic classes, you can
        try your luck with the <a
        href="usage.html#ignorewarnings"><code>-ignorewarnings</code></a>
        option, or even
        the <a href="usage.html#dontwarn"><code>-dontwarn</code></a> option.
        Only use these options if you really know what you're doing though.
        <p>
        For example, if you're developing for Android, and DexGuard complains
        that it can't find a <code>java.awt</code> class, then some library
        that you are using is referring to <code>java.awt</code>. This is a
        bit shady, since Android doesn't have this package at all, but if your
        application works anyway, you can let DexGuard accept it with
        "<code>-dontwarn java.awt.**</code>".</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    This last solution is commonly necessary in the standard Android build
    process. The standard build script automatically passes the libraries that
    it can find in the <code>libs</code> directory to DexGuard. Unfortunately,
    many third-party libraries refer to other libraries that are not actually
    used and not present. This works fine in debug builds, but in release
    builds, DexGuard expects all libraries, so it can perform a proper static
    analysis. For example, if DexGuard complains that it can't find
    a <code>java.awt</code> class, then some library that you are using is
    referring to <code>java.awt</code>. This is a bit shady, since Android
    doesn't have this package at all, but if your application works anyway,
    you can let DexGuard accept it with "<code>-dontwarn java.awt.**</code>",
    for instance.
    <p>
    If the missing class is an Android run-time class, you should make sure
    that you are building against an Android run-time that is sufficiently
    recent. You may need to change the build target in your
    <code>project.properties</code> file or <code>build.gradle</code> file to
    that recent version. You can still specify a different
    <code>minSdkVersion</code> and a different <code>targetSdkVersion</code>
    in your <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> file.</dd>

<dt><a name="superclass"><b>Error: Can't find any super classes of ... (not even immediate super class ...)</b><br/><b>Error: Can't find common super class of ... and ...</b></a></dt>

<dd>It seems like you tried to avoid the warnings from the previous paragraph
    by specifying
    <a href="usage.html#ignorewarnings"><code>-ignorewarnings</code></a>
    or <a href="usage.html#dontwarn"><code>-dontwarn</code></a>, but it didn't
    work out. DexGuard's optimization step and preverification step really
    need the missing classes to make sense of the code. Preferably, you would
    solve the problem by adding the missing library, as discussed. If you're
    sure the class that references the missing class isn't used either, you
    could also try filtering it out from the input, by adding a filter to the
    corresponding <a href="usage.html#injars"><code>-injars</code></a> option:
    "<code>-injars
    myapplication.jar(!somepackage/SomeUnusedClass.class)</code>". As a final
    solution, you could switch off optimization
    (<a href="usage.html#dontoptimize"><code>-dontoptimize</code></a>) and
    preverification
    (<a href="usage.html#dontpreverify"><code>-dontpreverify</code></a>).</dd>

<dt><a name="unresolvedprogramclassmember"><b>Warning: can't find referenced field/method '...' in program class ...</b></a></dt>

<dd>A program class is referring to a field or a method that is missing from
    another program class. The warning lists both the referencing class and
    the missing referenced class member. Your compiled class files are most
    likely inconsistent. Possibly, some class file didn't get recompiled
    properly, or some class file was left behind after its source file was
    removed. Try removing all compiled class files and rebuilding your
    project.</dd>

<dt><a name="unresolvedlibraryclassmember"><b>Warning: can't find referenced field/method '...' in library class ...</b></a></dt>

<dd>A program class is referring to a field or a method that is missing from a
    library class. The warning lists both the referencing class and the
    missing referenced class member. Your compiled class files are
    inconsistent with the libraries. You may need to recompile the class
    files, or otherwise upgrade the libraries to consistent versions.
    <p>
    If DexGuard complains that it can't find a method that is only available in
    a recent version of the Android run-time, you should change the build
    target in your <code>project.properties</code> file or
    <code>build.gradle</code> file to that recent version. You can still
    specify a different <code>minSdkVersion</code> and a different
    <code>targetSdkVersion</code> in your <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> file.
    <p>
    <ol>
    <li>If there are unresolved references to class members in <i>program
        classes</i>, your compiled class files are most likely inconsistent.
        Possibly, some class file didn't get recompiled properly, or some
        class file was left behind after its source file was removed. Try
        removing all compiled class files and rebuilding your project.</li>
    <li>If there are unresolved references to class members in <i>library
        classes</i>, your compiled class files are inconsistent with the
        libraries. You may need to recompile the class files, or otherwise
        upgrade the libraries to consistent versions.
        <p>
        For example, if you're developing for Android, and DexGuard complains
        that it can't find a run-time method that is only available in recent
        versions of Android, you should change the target in
        <code>project.properties</code> to that recent version.
        <p>
        Alternatively, you may get away with ignoring the inconsistency with
        the options
        <a href="usage.html#ignorewarnings"><code>-ignorewarnings</code></a>
        or even
        <a href="usage.html#dontwarn"><code>-dontwarn</code></a>. For
        instance if the code contains a class to optionally support recent
        versions of Android, you can specify "<code>-dontwarn
        mypackage.MySupportClass</code>".</li>
    <li>If your program classes reside in the same packages as library classes,
        and refer to their package visible class members, then you should also
        specify the
        <a href="usage.html#dontskipnonpubliclibraryclassmembers"><code>-dontskipnonpubliclibraryclassmembers</code></a>
        option.</li>
    </ol></dd>

<dt><a name="unresolvedenclosingmethod"><b>Warning: can't find enclosing class/method</b></a></dt>

<dd>If there are unresolved references to classes that are defined inside
    methods in your input, once more, your compiled class files are most likely
    inconsistent. Possibly, some class file didn't get recompiled properly, or
    some class file was left behind after its source file was removed. Try
    removing all compiled class files and rebuilding your project.</dd>

<dt><a name="dependency"><b>Warning: library class ... depends on program class ...</b></a></dt>

<dd>If any of your library classes depend on your program classes, by
    extending, implementing or just referencing them, your processed code will
    generally be unusable. Program classes can depend on library classes, but
    not the other way around. Program classes are processed, while library
    classes always remain unchanged. It is therefore impossible to adapt
    references from library classes to program classes, for instance if the
    program classes are renamed. You should define a clean separation between
    program code (specified with <a
    href="usage.html#injars"><code>-injars</code></a>) and library code
    (specified with <a
    href="usage.html#libraryjars"><code>-libraryjars</code></a>), and try
    again.
    <p>
    Sloppy libraries may contain duplicates of classes that are already present
    in the Android run-time (notably <code>org.w3c.dom</code>,
    <code>org.xml.sax</code>, <code>org.xmlpull.v1</code>,
    <code>org.apache.commons.logging.Log</code>, <code>org.apache.http</code>,
    and <code>org.json</code>). You must remove these classes from your
    libraries, since they are possibly inconsistent, and the run-time libraries
    would get precedence anyway.</dd>

<dt><a name="disappearingclasses"><b>Disappearing classes</b></a></dt>

<dd>If you are working on Windows and it looks like some classes have
    disappeared from your output, you should make sure you're not writing your
    output class files to a directory (or unpacking the output jar). On
    platforms with case-insensitive file systems, such as Windows, unpacking
    tools often let class files with similar lower-case and upper-case names
    overwrite each other. If you really can't switch to a different operating
    system, you could consider using DexGuard's <a
    href="usage.html#dontusemixedcaseclassnames"><code>-dontusemixedcaseclassnames</code></a>
    option.
    <p>
    Also, you should make sure your class files are in directories that
    correspond to their package names. DexGuard will read misplaced class
    files, but it will currently not write their processed versions. Notably,
    class files that are in the <code>WEB-INF/classes</code> directory in a
    war should be packaged in a jar and put in the <code>WEB-INF/lib</code>
    directory.</dd>

<dt><a name="notkept"><b>Classes or class members not being kept</b></a></dt>

<dd>If DexGuard is not keeping the right classes or class members, make sure
    you are using fully qualified class names. If the package name of some
    class is missing, DexGuard won't match the elements that you might be
    expecting. It may help to double-check for typos too. You can use the <a
    href="usage.html#printseeds"><code>-printseeds</code></a> option to see
    which elements are being kept exactly.
    <p>
    If you are using marker interfaces to keep other classes, the marker
    interfaces themselves are probably being removed in the shrinking step.
    You should therefore always explicitly keep any marker interfaces, with
    an option like "<code>-keep interface MyMarkerInterface</code>".
    <p>
    Similarly, if you are keeping classes based on annotations, you may have
    to avoid that the annotation classes themselves are removed in the
    shrinking step. You should package the annotation classes as a library, or
    explicitly keep them in your program code with an option like "<code>-keep
    @interface *</code>".</dd>

    Furthermore, you should check how you have specified the strings: string
    literals, all the strings in specified classes, all the strings in
    specified methods, or all the uses of specified string constants. Note
    that the Java compiler inlines such string constants whereever they are

    <p>
    If all of this seems ok, perhaps there's a bug in DexGuard (gasp!). If so,
    please report it, preferably with the simplest example on which you can
    find DexGuard to fail.</dd>

<dd>Verification errors when executing a program are almost certainly the
    result of a bug in the optimization step of DexGuard. Make sure you are
    using the latest version. You should be able to work around the problem by
    using the <a href="usage.html#dontoptimize"><code>-dontoptimize</code></a>
    option. Please report it to us, preferably with the simplest example on
    which DexGuard fails, so we can fix it as quickly as possible..</dd>
