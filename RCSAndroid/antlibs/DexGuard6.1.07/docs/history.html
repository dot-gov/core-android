    arguments.

<li>Added check on modification times of input and output, to avoid unnecessary
    processing, with new option <code>-forceprocessing</code>.

    <code>-repackageclasses</code> (replacing <code>-defaultpackage</code>) to
    control obfuscation of package names.
<li>Added new options <code>-adaptresourcefilenames</code> and
    <code>-adaptresourcefilecontents</code>, with file filters, to update
    resource files corresponding to obfuscated class names.
<li>Added detection of dynamically accessed fields and methods.
<li>Now treating <code>Exceptions</code> attributes as optional.
<li>Now respecting naming rule for nested class names
    (<code>EnclosingClass$InnerClass</code>) in obfuscation step, if

    attributes are being kept.

    of constant fields, constant arguments, and constant return values.
<li>Added optimized local variable allocation.
<li>Added more than 250 new peephole optimizations.

</ul>
Upgrade considerations:
<ul>

<li>Since ProGuard now treats the <code>Exceptions</code> attribute as
    optional, you may have to specify <code>-keepattributes Exceptions</code>,
    notably when processing code that is to be used as a library.

<li>ProGuard now preverifies code for Java Micro Edition, if you specify the
    option <code>-microedition</code>. You then no longer need to process the
    code with an external preverifier.

<li>You should preferably specify <code>-repackageclasses</code> instead of the
    old option name <code>-defaultpackage</code>.
