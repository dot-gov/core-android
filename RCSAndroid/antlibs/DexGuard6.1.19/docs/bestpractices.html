<h2>Best Practices</h2>

In this section, we describe recommended steps to harden code against reverse
engineering. The idea is to apply different techniques to create multiple
layers of obfuscation. Although no single technique is unbreakable, each layer
further raises the bar for attackers. The different techniques protect the
application code, but they also protect one another. We go over each of the
techniques, explaining why they are useful, how you can apply them, and how
you can verify their effects.

<h3><a name="coredesign">Core design</a></h3>

<h4>Discussion</h4>

The essential basis for a hardened application is a sound design and a robust
implementation. Even if you will obfuscate your code, you should look at it as
if it is open source and consider the worst-case scenarios. The details are
application-specific and lie outside the scope of this guide, but you can find
the a lot of basic principles in books, blogs, and online presentations.

<h3><a name="securecommunication">First layer: secure communication</a></h3>

<h4>Discussion</h4>

If your application communicates with a server, you should encrypt the
communication with SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or the more recent TLS
(Transport Layer Security). These protocols have been developed for secure
communication between a web browser and a server. In a web browser, a user can
see the padlock icon when the communication is secure. In an Android
application, the user doesn't see a padlock icon, so the developer shouldn't
forget to use SSL when appropriate.
<p>
The server contains a chain of certificates with public keys and certified
names. You can obtain a certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA). With
the standard Android API, the Android runtime checks such a chain with its
database of root certificates. Alternatively, you can create a self-signed
certificate. You then need to check the certificate yourself in your
application.
<p>
Occasionally, a Certificate Authority is compromised (as happened with Comodo
and DigiNotar). New releases of Android then typically update the database of
root certificates. However, if your application always communicates with the
same server, it should <i>pin</i> the certificate or its public key, i.e. only
accept a minimal, fixed list of trusted certificates or keys. This technique
ensures that the application is always talking to the right server and blocks
man-in-the-middle attacks. You should be aware that some large websites update
their certificates and keys regularly.

<h4>Configuration</h4>

You can find the code to create connections with certificate pinning or public
key pinning for different Android APIs in the
sample <code>samples/SSLPinning</code>.


<h4>Verification</h4>

<ul>
<li>Certificate pinning: remove your trust store from the assets. The server
    requests should no longer work.</li>
<li>Public key pinning: change your list of trusted hashes. The server
    requests should no longer work.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="nameobfuscation">Second layer: name obfuscation</a></h3>

<h4>Discussion</h4>

DexGuard can obfuscate names in the applications that it processes. This means
that it renames classes, fields, and methods using meaningless names,
whereever possible. By default, it uses UTF-8 characters that are difficult to
distinguish. This obfuscation step makes the code base smaller and harder to
reverse-engineer.

<h4>Configuration</h4>

In release builds, DexGuard automatically applies name obfuscation. For any
names of classes, fields, and methods that are involved in reflection, this
may not be suitable. DexGuard's default configuration already takes care of
common entry points like activities, intentions, etc. If other classes,
fields, or methods need to keep their original names, you should specify the
proper <code><a href="usage.html#keep">-keep</a></code> options.

<h4>Verification</h4>

You can find the map of original names to obfuscated names in
<code>bin/proguard/mapping.txt</code> (with Ant),
<code>proguard/mapping.txt</code> (with Eclipse), or
<code>build/outputs/proguard/release/mapping.txt</code> (with Gradle).
<p>
Such a mapping file may look like this:
<pre>
com.example.HelloWorldActivity -&gt; com.example.HelloWorldActivity:
    39:42:void onCreate(android.os.Bundle) -&gt; onCreate
com.example.Util -&gt; o.&#xFF65;:
    byte[] values -&gt; &#xFF65;
    int doSomething(android.content.Context) -&gt; &#xFF65;
    java.lang.String compute(android.content.Context) -&gt; &#x02CA;
</pre>
Note that names from the Android runtime are not obfuscated, since obfuscating
them would break the application.
<p>
You can also see the obfuscated names if you disassemble the code with a tool
like dexdump (<code>build-tools/20.0.0/dexdump</code> in the Android SDK), or
baksmali (free and open-source: 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/smali/">code.google.com/p/smali/</a>).
<p>
In the debug version of the application, the names are still readable:
<pre>
  Class descriptor  : 'Lcom/example/Util;
  ...
    #0              : (in Lcom/example/Util;)
      name          : 'values'
      ...
</pre>
In the hardened release version of the application, the names are obfuscated:
<pre>
  Class descriptor  : 'Lo/&#xFF65;;'
  ...
    #0              : (in Lo/&#xFF65;;)
      name          : '&#xFF65;'
      ...
</pre>

</ul>


<h3><a name="stringencryption">Third layer: string encryption</a></h3>

<h4>Discussion</h4>

String constants in the source code are still readable in the compiled
application, with a disassembler like dexdump or baksmali, or a decompiler for
Dalvik bytecode. You should let DexGuard encrypt sensitive string constants,
so they become invisible to static analysis. Keys, tokens,
communication-related strings, and log messages are all good candidates for
encryption. Note that string encryption is actually a form of obfuscation,
since the strings necessarily have to be decrypted at runtime.

<h4>Configuration</h4>

You can apply string encryption with the option
<code><a href="usage.html#encryptstrings">-encryptstrings</a></code>. It
offers a number of ways to specify the strings to be encrypted. The most
common ones:
<ul>
<li>Obfuscate the specified string constant:
<pre>
-encryptstrings class com.example.MyConstants {
    public static final java.lang.String SECRET_KEY;
}
</pre>
Be aware that the Java compiler already inlines final string constants
whereever they are used in the code, which may be in other classes. They may
have spread throughout the code before DexGuard processes it. With the above
configuration, DexGuard encrypts these constants throughout the code, to
provide the expected results.
</li>
<li>Obfuscate all string constants actually used in the specified class:
<pre>
-encryptstrings class com.example.MySecretClass
</pre>
This configuration is convenient if you can identify one or more sensitive
classes.
</li>
</ul>
All options accept wildcards. Technically, it is possible to encrypt all
strings in all classes in the code, but this is generally not advisable for
performance reasons.

<h4>Verification</h4>

In the debug version of the application, you'll easily find the original
strings with a disassembler. For instance:
<pre>
... const-string v0, "Hello world!"
</pre>
In the release version of the application, encrypted strings should no longer
be visible.

<li><a href="verification.html">Verification</a></li>
</ul>


<h3><a name="reflection">Fourth layer: reflection</a></h3>

<h4>Discussion</h4>

Name obfuscation can't change invocations of runtime classes, methods, and
fields, since that would break the application's code. These invocations
therefore remain conveniently readable in the disassembled or decompiled code.
This provides attackers a lot of information about the structure and execution
flow of the application. Especially for sensitive APIs, such as encryption and
secure communication, you may want to make the code less readable by replacing
the direct invocations by reflection.
<p>
You can let DexGuard replace invocations by reflection and then encrypt the
resulting strings. They then become difficult to find with static analysis.

<h4>Configuration</h4>

For example, encrypt some invocations of the <code>SecureRandom</code> with
the option
<code><a href="usage.html#accessthroughreflection">-accessthroughreflection</a></code>:
<pre>
-accessthroughreflection class java.security.SecureRandom {
    &lt;init&gt;();
    int nextInt();
}
</pre>
You should combine the reflection with string encryption. More specifically,
you can enumerate all strings that are created for the reflection:
<pre>
-encryptstrings "java.security.SecureRandom", "nextInt"
</pre>
An easier approach may be to encrypt all strings in the class that invokes the 
cryptographic classes:
<pre>
-encryptstrings class com.example.MySecretClass
</pre>

<h4>Verification</h4>

In the debug version of the application, you'll easily find the original
method invocation with a disassembler. For instance:
<pre>
... new-instance v0, Ljava/security/SecureRandom;
... invoke-direct {v0}, Ljava/security/SecureRandom;.<init>:()V
...
... invoke-virtual {v0}, Ljava/security/SecureRandom;.nextInt:()I
</pre>
In the hardened release version of the application., you can check that any
invocations that you have specified are no longer visible

</ul>


<h3><a name="logging">Fifth layer: removing logging code and stack traces</a></h3>

<h4>Discussion</h4>

Logging code provides attackers information about the structure and execution
flow of the application. From the perspective of thwarting reverse engineering,
you should not leave logging code in released applications. If your logging
code (or the logging code in your external libraries) does not depend on
compile-time flags like
<code>Build.DEBUG</code>, you can let DexGuard remove logging calls for you.

<h4>Configuration</h4>

Remove all standard Android logging invocations:
<pre>
-assumenosideeffects class android.util.Log {
    public static boolean isLoggable(java.lang.String, int);
    public static int v(...);
    public static int i(...);
    public static int w(...);
    public static int d(...);
    public static int e(...);
    public static java.lang.String
                    getStackTraceString(java.lang.Throwable);
}
</pre>
<p>
Remove all printing of stack traces:
<pre>
-assumenosideeffects class java.lang.Exception {
    public void printStackTrace();
}
</pre>

<h4>Verification</h4>

In the debug version of the application, you may find many logging invocations
with a disassembler. For instance:
<pre>
... invoke-static {v0, v1}, Landroid/util/Log;.d:(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)I
</pre>
In the release version of the application, all of these invocation should be
gone.

</ul>



<h3><a name="tamperdetection">Sixth layer: tamper detection</a></h3>

<h4>Discussion</h4>

Attackers can extract information like encryption and decryption keys by
injecting logging code into an application. They disassemble the application,
insert logging code, and run the application again. Their logging code can
print out decrypted strings, which include the keys.
<p>
You can fight this type of dynamic analysis by adding tamper detection to your 
application. Tamper detection actively checks the integrity of the application 
at runtime and acts suitably if the application has been modified.

<h4>Configuration</h4>

DexGuard offers tamper detection with simple methods that you can call from 
your application. You first need to add the library 
<code>samples/TamperDetection/libs/dexguard_util.jar</code> to your
application. You can then invoke the tamper detection methods in the
application and act based on their return values.
<ul>
<li>Check the integrity of the entiry apk file:
<pre>
int check = dexguard.util.TamperDetector.checkApk(context);
if (check != 0) {
    // Tampering detected.
    ...
}
</pre>
</li>
<li>Check whether the application is still signed with the original certificate:
<pre>
int check = dexguard.util.CertificateChecker.checkCertificate(context);
if (check != 0) {
    // Different certificate detected.
    ...
}
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
Both methods accept an optional additional integer parameter, which they
return instead of 0 if the checks are ok. You can pick such a parameter to
make the code less predictable.
<p>
You should weave the tamper detection code into your regular code, making it
more difficult to simply disable it. For instance, you could use the return
value to affect the computation of a key, so the computed key is wrong if the
application has been tampered with. A simplistic example:
<pre>
int checkedKey = dexguard.util.TamperDetector.checkApk(context, key);
</pre>
<p>
If the code detects tampering, the application should fail quietly, possibly
with a delay, without giving away any further information.
<p>
Once you have added your tamper detection code, you should further harden it
by encrypting its class, together with the tamper detection library
(<code>dexguard.util.**</code>).

<h4>Verification</h4>

You can check if the tamper detection works by unpacking the application and
repackaging it, for instance with unzip and zip. You can also tamper with the
application simply by applying the standard tool zipalign:
<pre>
zipalign -f 4 myapplication.apk
</pre>
The tool repackages the application without fundamentally changing it. This
will trigger the tamper detection at runtime.
<p>
You can check the certificate verification by re-signing the application with
a different certificate:
<pre>
zip -d MyApp.apk META-INF/*
jarsigner -keystore debug.keystore -storepass android -keypass android -signedjar \
    MyApp_signed.apk MyApp.apk AndroidDebugKey
</pre>
This will trigger the certificate check at runtime.

<ul>
<li>Working sample project: <code>samples/TamperDetection</code></li>
</ul>


<h3><a name="environmentchecks">Seventh layer: environment checks</a></h3>

<h4>Discussion</h4>

Even if the application is unaltered, the underlying runtime may be subverted.
The application calls into the Android runtime in good faith, but the runtime
code may have been compromised. It may for instance intercept method calls
that communicate or decrypt sensitive data, and pass the results to an
attacker.
<p>
You may therefore want to check the environment in which the application is
running. This is tricky, since the subverted environment may be constructed to
look as ordinary and inconspicuous as possible. Nevertheless, you can perform
some basic sanity checks:
<ul>
<li>Check whether the application is debuggable or is being debugged.</li>
<li>Check whether the application is running in an emulator.</li>
<li>Check whether the application is running on a rooted device.</li>
</ul>
Like tamper detection, these techniques actively check the integrity of the
application and its environment at runtime. You can then act suitably if the
environment is not the standard intended environment.

<h4>Configuration</h4>

DexGuard offers environment checks as simple methods that you can call from 
your application. You first need to add the library 
<code>samples/EnvironmentCheck/libs/dexguard_util.jar</code> to your
application. You can then invoke the environment checking methods in the
application and act based on their return values.
<ul>
<li>Check whether the application is debuggable:
<pre>
int check = dexguard.util.DebugDetector.isDebuggable(context);
if (check != 0) {
    // Application is debuggable.
    ...
}
</pre>
</li>
<li>Check whether the application is being debugged:
<pre>
int check = dexguard.util.DebugDetector.isDebuggerConnected();
if (check != 0) {
    // Application is being debugged.
    ...
}
</pre>
</li>
<li>Check whether the application has been signed with a debug key:
<pre>
int check = dexguard.util.DebugDetector.isSignedWithDebugKey(context);
if (check != 0) {
    // Application has been signed with a debug key.
    ...
}
</pre>
</li>
<li>Check whether the application is running in an emulator:
<pre>
int check = dexguard.util.EmulatorDetector.isRunningInEmulator(context);
if (check != 0) {
    // Application is running in an emulator.
    ...
}
</pre>
</li>
<li>Check whether the application is running on a rooted device:
<pre>
int check = dexguard.utilRootDetector.isDeviceRooted();
if (check != 0) {
    // Application is running on a rooted device.
    ...
}
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
All methods accept an optional additional integer parameter. which they return
instead of 0 if the checks are ok. You can pick such a parameter to make the
code less predictable.
<p>
You should again weave the tamper detection code into your regular code and
further harden it by encrypting the class together with the library
(<code>dexguard.util.**</code>).

<h4>Verification</h4>

If you have implemented these checks, you can try setting the debug flag,
running the application in an emulator, or running the application on a rooted
device.

</ul>


<h3><a name="classencryption">Eighth layer: class encryption</a></h3>

<h4>Discussion</h4>

Name obfuscation, string encryption, and reflection already help against
static analysis, and tamper detection and environment checks help against
dynamic analysis. Class encryption can provide another powerful layer over
these techniques. It can completely hide the decryption code and reflection
code, hardening it against static analysis and against tampering.
<p>
Encrypting all classes is not technically possible and would add an excessive
overhead. You should identify a number of sensitive classes and encrypt those.
Typically, these are the classes that you have already hardened with other
techniques. For instance, you should include your tamper detection code and
the associated library classes.

<h4>Configuration</h4>

You can specify the classes that you want to encrypt with the option <code>
<a href="usage.html#encryptclasses">-encryptclasses</a></code>:
<pre>
-encryptclasses com.example.MySecretClass,
                com.example.MySecretClass$*
</pre>
The second name in the list matches all inner classes of
<code>MySecretClass</code>, since inner classes often also contain sensitive
code.

<h4>Verification</h4>

Applying a disassembler, you may find traces of string encryption, reflection,
tamper detection, environment checks, and original code in the hardened
release version of the application.
<p>
After having added class encryption for the class that contains such code, it 
will no longer be visible or modifiable.
