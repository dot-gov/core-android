<h2>Eclipse Plugin</h2>

<b>DexGuard</b> can be integrated in the Eclipse build process of the Android
Developer Tools (version 23.0.1.1256982 or higher).

<h3>Setting up the Eclipse plugin</h3>

You can enable DexGuard in the Android Eclipse build as follows:
<ol>
<li>Optionally copy the configuration file from DexGuard's <code>ant</code>
    directory to the main directory of your Android project:
<pre>
dexguard-project.txt
</pre></li>
<li>Copy the plugin from DexGuard's <code>eclipse</code> directory to
    the <code>dropins</code> directory of your Eclipse install:
<pre>
com.saikoa.dexguard.eclipse.adt_*.jar
</pre></li>
</ol>

When starting or restarting Eclipse, the Android build process will
automatically use DexGuard for all Android builds. You can verify that the
plugin is installed by checking that the menu item discussed below is present.
If Eclipse didn't pick up the plugin, you should try starting it with
the <code>-clean</code> option.
<p>
If you experience any compatibility problems, you should check and possibly
update the version of the plugin of the Android Developer Tools:
<blockquote>
Help &gt; About Eclipse SDK &gt; Installation Details &gt; Installed Software
</blockquote>

<h3>Building</h3>

The procedure for building Android applications remains essentially the same.
Ordinary builds use debug settings, without optimization or obfuscation. A new
<i>Export</i> option allows you to build with the release settings, with full
optimization and obfuscation:
<blockquote>
File &gt; Export... &gt; Export Optimized and Obfuscated Android Application
(DexGuard)
</blockquote>
<p>
<img src="eclipse/file.png" width="573" height="26" alt="Menu bar" />
<p>

<a href="eclipse/file_export.png">
<img class="float" src="eclipse/file_export_small.png" width="172" height="235" alt="File menu" />
</a>

<a href="eclipse/export.png">
<img src="eclipse/export_small.png" width="306" height="275" alt="Export panel" hspace="50" />
</a>
<p>

The DexGuard Eclipse plugin picks up custom configurations from the following
optional files in your Android project:
<pre>
dexguard-project.txt         (for all builds)
dexguard-project-debug.txt   (for debug builds)
dexguard-project-release.txt (for release builds)
proguard-project.txt         (for backward compatibility with ProGuard)
</pre>
The default version of the first file contains a number of settings that can
be enabled to perform string encryption, class encryption, and to hide access
to sensitive APIs.
<p>

The logs for debug builds and export builds are sent to the Android console
panel.

<h3>Settings</h3>

You can selectively override settings from the configuration files in the
preferences panel:
<blockquote>
Window &gt; Preferences &gt; Android &gt; Obfuscation (DexGuard)
</blockquote>
<p>
<img src="eclipse/window.png" width="573" height="26" alt="Menu bar" />
<p>

<a href="eclipse/window_preferences.png">
<img class="float" src="eclipse/window_preferences_small.png" width="128" height="165" alt="Window menu" />
</a>

<a href="eclipse/preferences.png">
<img src="eclipse/preferences_small.png" width="348" height="290" alt="Preferences panel" hspace="50" />
</a>
<p>

By default, debug builds don't shrink, optimize, or obfuscate the application.
You can enable shrinking if your application is otherwise too large for the
size constraints of the Dalvik format. Make sure that you have suitable
configuration files for your project, so DexGuard doesn't inadvertedly remove
code that is only accessed through reflection. If you only enable shrinking,
you can still debug the processed application interactively. If you enable
optimization or obfuscation, it's generally no longer possible to debug the
processed application interactively, since the bytecode no longer corresponds
closely to the source code.
<p>

On the other hand, export builds generally do shrink, optimize, and obfuscate
the application. You can interactively disable any of these steps if ever
needed.

<h3>Settings for regular builds</h3>

You can specify the same general preferences as before. Notably, you can
specify the verbosity of the build process (including DexGuard) in the
preferences panel:
<blockquote>
Window &gt; Preferences &gt; Android &gt; Build
</blockquote>
<p>

You can also disable the DexGuard builder for regular builds, in the properties
panel of each project:
<blockquote>
Project &gt; Properties &gt; Builders &gt; Android Optimizer and Obfuscator (DexGuard)
</blockquote>
<p>
<img src="eclipse/project.png" width="573" height="26" alt="Menu bar" />
<p>

<a href="eclipse/project_properties.png">
<img class="float" src="eclipse/project_properties_small.png" width="123" height="110" alt="Project menu" />
</a>
<p>

<a href="eclipse/properties.png">
<img src="eclipse/properties_small.png" width="445" height="271" alt="Properties panel" hspace="50" />
</a>
<p>

After having disabled the builder, you currently need to restart the project
to properly reinitialize the builders.

<h3>Quick troubleshooting</h3>

If you are having problems running the Eclipse plugin:
<ul>
<li><b>NoClassDefFoundError, AbstractMethodError,...</b>: make sure that you
    are using the DexGuard plugin with the proper version of the Android
    plugins in Eclipse. Even minor version differences can cause compatibility
    problems. Feel free to check with us if you think the DexGuard plugin is
    incompatible with a recent Android plugin.</li>
<li>If the plugin doesn't seem to be active, you can get more information by
    starting Eclipse with the options <code>-clean -console -consoleLog
    -debug</code>. The separate console window then provides more information
    about the inner workings of Eclipse and its plugins.</li>
<li>If the plugin does work, the Android tab of the Console panel (Window &gt;
    Show View &gt; Console) contains log output for debug builds and export
    builds. You should check if it contains any information about the
    problem.</li>
<li><b>Invalid resource directory name: .../bin/res/crunch</b>: try clearing
    your application project and any library projects in Eclipse. Some internal
    tool has created this directory, confusing another tool later on.
<li>If exported applications are not optimized or obfuscated, make sure that
    the checkboxes in the preferences panel to disable optimization and
    obfuscation are unchecked.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Please consult the more extensive
<a href="troubleshooting.html">troubleshooting</a> section if you encounter
other issues building or running your application.

<h3>Uninstalling the Eclipse plugin</h3>

You can uninstall the plugin by removing the
file <code>com.saikoa.dexguard.eclipse.adt_*.jar</code> again from
the <code>dropins</code> directory of your Eclipse install.
